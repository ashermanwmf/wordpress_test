<p>
I am a Digital Communications Specialist with a passion for user experience, content and community management, and analytics. My background in Web Design and CSS helps me to work dynamically with campaigning/marketing.

<p>
My work and play are similar because they both occur on the same machine. I am fortunate to know so much about myself and I want to know more about the world. I learn something new everyday through the internet and tend to back source and do my own searches to grasp a curious concept. The world is full of connections and I have found a way to experience them.
